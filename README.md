# Welcome

In the wake of a tragedy such as the Orlando shooting, we must now more than ever remember that it is love and kindness that binds us together. In a time filled with hatred and ignorance, we must find support in each other and remind ourselves that there still remains good in the world. However, amongst angry YouTube comments and Twitter rants, it can sometimes be difficult to find the good. That's where The Gandhi Project comes in.

The Gandhi Project, or Gandhi for short, is a Chrome extension that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification and machine learning to erase hateful and distasteful comments on the internet. Trained using over 6,000 hand-classified tweets, Gandhi figures out which comments are negative and removes them from the page before you even have a chance to read them. Currently, only YouTube and Facebook are supported.
